Tauri Migration Checklist (Option B) — file-by-file scope
This is the concrete work required to move macOS only to Tauri while keeping Electron on Windows/Linux. Each item maps to real code in your repo.

Read alongside SURF_FED_TAURI_FEASIBILITY_STUDY.md. The blocker items (🚫) are why Option A is recommended.

1. New files you must create
 src-tauri/Cargo.toml — Rust manifest with tauri crate dependency.
 src-tauri/src/main.rs / src-tauri/src/lib.rs — Rust entry; window creation moves here from main.js's createWindow().
 src-tauri/tauri.conf.json — Tauri config. Set: - build.frontendDist → a web-asset folder (e.g. ../dist-web), NOT the Electron dist/ (which holds installers). - build.beforeBuildCommand → your web build step (or empty if static). - bundle.targets → ["dmg"] (add ["app"] if you want the .app too). - app.windows[].title → Surf FED, dimensions to match main.js (1200x800, minWidth 600, minHeight 400). - app.windows[].icon → reuse assets/icons/icon.png (Tauri wants .icns for macOS; generate with tauri icon).
 src-tauri/capabilities/*.json — Tauri v2 permission/capability files for any plugins you use (dialog, window, etc.).
 platform.js (shared) — abstraction so renderer.js can call either Electron IPC or Tauri invoke() depending on runtime.
2. package.json changes
 Add devDependency: @tauri-apps/cli.
 Add script: "tauri": "tauri".
 Keep "dist": "electron-builder" and the build block (still used by the Windows/Linux Electron jobs).
 Add a web-build script that copies index.html, renderer.js, styles.css, assets/ into dist-web/ for Tauri to consume.
3. main.js — does NOT run in Tauri (428 lines, Electron-only)
Every item below is Electron API that has no direct Tauri equivalent:

 🚫 session.fromPartition() + session.loadExtension() — the entire extension loading system. No equivalent in Tauri/WebKit. This breaks all four built-in extensions on macOS.
 🚫 app.on('web-contents-created') webview hook — no <webview> in Tauri.
 BrowserWindow creation → replaced by Tauri window config + Rust.
 webPreferences: { webviewTag: true } → N/A.
 ipcMain.handle('extensions:list'|'enable'|'disable'|'add'|'remove'|...) → re implemented as Rust #[tauri::command] functions (only the non-extension-loading parts, e.g. listing manifests, can survive).
 ipcMain.on('window:minimize'|'maximize'|'close') → Tauri window APIs (appWindow.minimize(), etc.) from the JS side, no Rust needed.
 dialog.showOpenDialog → Tauri dialog plugin (@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog).
 shell.openPath → Tauri opener/shell plugin.
 builtinExtDir() asar-unpacked path logic → Electron-only; delete on the Tauri path.
 app.getPath('userData') → Tauri path plugin app data dir.
4. preload.js — does NOT run in Tauri (20 lines)
 contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electronAPI', ...) → replace with a platform.js shim that uses invoke() from @tauri-apps/api/core.
 Every ipcRenderer.send/invoke → a Tauri command or plugin call.
5. renderer.js — partial rewrite (248 lines)
 🚫 document.createElement('webview') + setAttribute('partition', ...) + allowpopups → no <webview> in Tauri. Tabs must be implemented with Tauri's webview/window management (e.g. a Rust-managed webview pool or tauri-plugin-webview). This is the biggest single rewrite.
 webview.loadURL / goBack / goForward / reload / getTitle / getURL → Tauri webview navigation APIs (different signatures, async).
 webview.addEventListener('did-stop-loading' / 'page-title-updated') → Tauri webview events (different event names/types).
 window.electronAPI.extensions.* → route through platform.js.
 window.electronAPI.minimize/maximize/close → Tauri window APIs.
6. index.html — minor
 The <webview> usage is dynamic (created in JS), so the HTML itself is mostly reusable. The injected analytics <script> (sites.super.myninja.ai) stays as-is.
 Ensure renderer.js is loaded the same way under Tauri's frontendDist.
7. Extensions — 🚫 the headline problem
For each built-in extension, the macOS/Tauri (WebKit) fate:

 🚫 ad-blocker — uses declarativeNetRequest. WebKit has no DNR. Would need a Rust-side request-blocking layer (e.g. intercept via Tauri's HTTP/webview APIs) — significant custom work.
 ⚠️ dark-reader — content script at document_start, all_frames. WebKit can inject JS via evaluateJavaScript, but per-frame, at document_start, across navigations is a custom reimplementation.
 🚫 fed-gram — background.service_worker + popup. No service-worker extension background in WebKit. The popup UI could become a Tauri window, but the background logic must move to Rust.
 ⚠️ page-info — content script + popup. Same injection issue as dark-reader; popup becomes a Tauri window.
Realistic outcomes for macOS: (a) Ship macOS without the Extensions panel (simplest, feature loss), or (b) Hand-port each extension to Rust + JS injection (weeks of work, and DNR still won't be a clean port).

8. macOS distribution extras
 Apple Developer ID certificate + notarization (add secrets APPLE_CERTIFICATE, APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD, APPLE_ID, APPLE_PASSWORD, APPLE_TEAM_ID and Tauri signing config). Without this, Gatekeeper blocks/quarantines the .dmg.
 Intel Mac support: add x86_64-apple-darwin Rust target and build a second DMG (currently only Apple Silicon via macos-14).
 App icon: generate .icns via npx tauri icon assets/icons/icon.png.
9. Workflow
 Use build.option-b-tauri-mac-electron-win-linux.yml (provided).
 The build-tauri-macos job will fail until items in section 1, 2, and the <webview> rewrite (5) are done and committed.
Effort estimate (rough)
Area	Effort	Extensions survive on macOS?
Tauri init + config + window/IPC	Medium (1–2 days)	n/a
<webview> → Tauri webview tab engine	High (3–5 days)	n/a
Extension runtime	Very high (weeks) or drop	No (unless hand-ported)
macOS signing/notarization	Medium (half day + Apple account)	n/a
Total to feature-parity macOS	Weeks	Only with custom reimplementation
Compare to Option A: ~5 minutes, full feature parity on all platforms.

Recommendation
Start with Option A (build.option-a-electron-all.yml) to ship now on all three platforms with extensions working everywhere. If you later want a smaller, native macOS binary and are willing to fund the extension rework, create a tauri-macos branch and use this checklist + Option B workflow.
